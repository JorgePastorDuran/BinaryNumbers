# BinaryNumbers
I wanted to share with you the latest project in which I have participated as a Teach Lead at EPAM Systems. It is an educational project for children between the ages of 13 and 16, in which they will learn binary numbers and the different operations between them. The result? An immersive experience that captures the attention of young people and offers them a different and more current way of learning.

I'm proud to say that the level is now fully playable and freely available in FORTNITE. The only thing you need to be able to play it is your reference number 6891-6601-6180.
